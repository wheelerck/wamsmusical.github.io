                <p>Waynesboro Area Middle School(WAMS) is a music-oriented school. They offer band, chorus, musicals, and other extra-curriculars for music-lovers. WAMS has incredible staff members that encourage students' interest in the arts. They have had a yearly musical since 2018. Both School House Rock! Jr. and Madagascar Jr.: A Musical Adventure have been performed. The stage crew is completely student-run, so there is always something for everyone.</p>

                The WAMS Musical was one of the greatest experiences of my life. It can be yours, too. Throughout this website, I have included information about how the musical works, how you can try out, and the people that make this musical possible.</p>
